At each level is given one weapon (sword, bow, mace) or one potion (blue or red). Weapons designed to reduce the hit points of the enemy, and the potion to increase the player hit points. Raised weapons displayed in the inventory, the left movement buttons.

There are three types of enemies: bat, ghost and ghoul. Ghoul is the strongest among them, the bat - the weakest. With each new level the enemy is becoming stronger. Thus, the first level will only bat. And on the last level you need to win all three enemies.
